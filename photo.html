    <h2 class="about-titles">What Is An Axolotl?</h2>
    <p>
      Legend has it that the axolotl is the Aztec god of lightning and fire,
      Xolotl, disguised as a salamander to avoid being sacrificed. But, to give
      you a simpler (and less dramatic) explanation, the axolotl is an
      interesting species of aquatic salamander that can be found in the wild in
      just one place; Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City. However, we wonâ€™t
      completely discredit the theory that they are all-powerful! Axolotls
      (pronounced akÂ·suhÂ·laaÂ·tls) are fairly small in size and come in a wide
      range of colors. Their unusual appearance has made them beloved by people
      all over the world and in turn, theyâ€™ve become highly popular as pets.
      Unfortunately, due to habitat destruction and the introduction of invasive
      fish species, these awesome little aquatic creatures are critically
      endangered. Because of this, they are typically bred in captivity for
      scientific research and protection. From axolotl pet care and the diet of
      an axolotl to all their quirks and amazing regenerative traits, here are
      some exciting facts about these unusual amphibians.

      <li> <strong>Axolotls are incredible healers!</strong> Like lizards that can regrow their tails, axolotls can regrow multiple body parts including its limbs and internal organs such as the brain, lungs and even heart! This makes them one of the most resilient animals on earth. </li>
      <li><strong>Axolotls look like babies their whole life!</strong> They are neotenic creatures which means they achieve sexual maturity without ever losing any of their larval features. So, while many amphibians like the salamander will eventually live on land, the axolotls reach adulthood without ever undergoing metamorphosis, so they keep their feathery external gills and remain aquatic. </li>
      <li><strong>Axolotls are carnivores!</strong> Because they are neotenic, their teeth never develop so they must rely on suction to consume food. When it comes to the diet of an axolotl, they do not require daily feeding but when they do eat, theyâ€™re not picky. Theyâ€™ll feast on anything from worms and fish to crustaceans and insects. </li>
      <li><strong>Axolotls come in all sorts of colors!</strong> The patterns and pigmentations vary but most often you will see pink, brown or black with specks of olive or gold. But something even cooler is that they can adjust their color to camouflage themselves with their surroundings. </li>
      <li><strong>Axolotls have a mating dance!</strong> Once they reach about six months old, they begin to mate and the process involves them moving together in a circular, dance-like fashion. Itâ€™s only right when courting a lady to invite her to dance, first!</li>
